/**
 * Rearrange array in alternating positive and negative number.
 * <p>
 * Given an array of positive and negative numbers, arrange them in an alternate fashion such that
 * every positive number is followed by negative and vice-versa maintaining the order of appearance.
 * <p>
 * Number of positive and negative numbers need not be equal. If there are more positive numbers
 * they appear at the end of the array. If there are more negative numbers, they too appear in the end of the array.
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * <p>
 * Input: {1, 2, 3, -4, -1, 4};
 * Output: {-4, 1, -1, 2, 3, 4}
 * <p>
 * Input: {-5, -2, 5, 2, 4, 7, 1, 8, 0, -8};
 * Output: {-5, 5, -2, 2, -8, 4, 7, 1, 8, 0}
