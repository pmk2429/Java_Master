/**
 * WAP that takes two arrays representing integers and returns an integer representing their product.
 * For ex, since -12 * 34 = -454,if the inputs are {-1,2} and {3,4}, your function should return {4,5,4}.
 * And the sign should be retained.
 * <p>
 * Cases to handle:
 * - If all 0s, then just return 1 0 and trim others
 * - Retain the sign of the number
