/**
 * Find the first word in a stream in which it is not repeated in the rest of
 * the stream. Please note that you are being provided a stream as a source for
 * the characters. The stream is guaranteed to eventually terminate (i.e. return
 * false from a call to the hasNext() method), though it could be very long. You
 * will access this stream through the provided interface methods. A call to
 * hasNext() will return whether the stream contains any more characters to
 * process. A call to getNext() will return the next character to be processed
 * in the stream. It is not possible to restart the stream. Example: Input: The
 * angry dog was red. And the cat was also angry. Output: dog In this example,
 * the word ‘dog’ is the first word in the stream in which it is not repeated in
 * the stream.
