/**
 * Distinct strings with odd and even changes allowed
 * Given an array of lower case strings, the task is to find the number of strings that are distinct.
 * Two strings are distinct if on applying the following operations on one string the second string cannot be formed.
 * <p>
 * A character on odd index can be swapped with another character at odd index only.
 * A character on even index can be swapped with another character on even index only.
 * Examples:
 * <p>
 * Input  : arr[] = {"abcd", "cbad", "bacd"}
 * Output : 2
 * The 2nd string can be converted to the 1st by swapping
 * the first and third characters. So there are 2 distinct
 * strings as the third string cannot be converted to the
 * first.
 * <p>
 * Input  : arr[] = {"abc", "cba"}
 * Output : 1
